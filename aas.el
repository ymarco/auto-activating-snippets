;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package implements an engine for auto-expanding snippets.
;; It is done by tracking your inputted chars along a tree until you
;; complete a registered key sequence.
;;
;; Its like running a long prefix command, but the keys you type are not
;; 'consumed' and appear in the buffer until you complete the whole command
;; --- and then the snippet is triggered!

Specification:

KEY-EXPANSIONS is a plist of snippet keys and their expansions.
keys must be strings, and expansions must be of these types:
- String, meaning the key would be replaced by the expansion
  string.
- Function, meaning the key would be removed and the function
  would be called interactively to modify the buffer.
- nil, meaning expansion for the key is disabled.

Additionally, a sequence of :cond FN can be inserted between
key-expansion pairs. This would make all the snippets writen
after the :cond first call FN (non-interactively), and only
expand if it returned non-nil. To remove a previously-set
condition, use :cond nil.

During the expansion process, user-provided functions for
conditions and expansions are free to use the variables
`aas-transient-snippet-key', `aas-transient-snippet-expansion',
`aas-transient-snippet-condition-result', which see.
